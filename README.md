# Kubernetes Practice with Nginx

This repository contains my practice exercises for deploying and managing **Nginx** on **Kubernetes**.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of Pods, Deployments, Services, and other Kubernetes concepts by working with a simple, widely used web server.

## 🚀 Project Overview
-- Deploy Nginx as a containerized application in Kubernetes.
- Explore different Kubernetes objects:
  - **Pod**: Running a single Nginx container.
  - **Deployment**: Managing replicas and rolling updates.
  - **Service**: Exposing Nginx to external traffic.
  - **ConfigMap & Secret**: Managing configuration and sensitive data.
  - **PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**: Attaching persistent storage to Nginx Pods.
  - **Ingress**: Routing external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to Nginx Services.
- Practice scaling, monitoring, and troubleshooting workloads.
